Project: Book Club

Group Member Names: Will Petty and Tom Nunez

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
-We both would like to do this project according to strict "best practice" in order to fully understand each aspect. Of course testing before anything will be crucial. We both also want to make sure that our commits are often and detailed. When it comes to working apart from each other waffle bot will be an important resource to utilize and master.

Goals and expectations: Finish all user story functionality by end of the day Monday, giving us two days to style and css.

How to overcome obstacles: Through clear communication, hopefully there will not be any problems due to the time we spent planning and talking through the project.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): Communication will always be constant because we have Slack, and waffle.io to always allow us to see what the other person is working on.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): We both would like to get better at testing and styling.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): commit after writing every single test, have the other partner review pull requests(unless partner gives permission).

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
